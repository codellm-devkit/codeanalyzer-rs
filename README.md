Native WALA implementation of source code analysis tool for Enterprise Rust Applications.

## 1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have a Linux/MacOS/WSL machine.
- You have installed the latest version of [Rustup](https://rustup.rs/)

### 1.1. Install Rustup

1. Install Rustup by running the following command:

   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```

   Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

2. Open a new terminal or source the Rust environment:

   ```bash
   source $HOME/.cargo/env
   ```

## 2. Building `codeanalyzer`

### 2.1. Install Rust

1. Ensure you have Rust installed:

   ```bash
   rustc --version
   ```

   If Rust is not installed, install it using Rustup:

   ```bash
   rustup install stable
   ```

2. Set Rust stable as the default version:

   ```bash
   rustup default stable
   ```

### 2.2. Build `codeanalyzer`

Clone the repository (if you haven't already) and navigate into the cloned directory.

Run the Cargo build command to compile the project:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

### 2.3. Using `codeanalyzer`

The binary will be built at `target/release/codeanalyzer`. It may be used as follows:

```help
Usage: ./codeanalyzer [-hvV] [--no-build] [-a=<analysisLevel>] [-i=<input>] [-o=<output>] [-s=<sourceAnalysis>]
Convert Rust binary into a comprehensive system dependency graph.
  -i, --input=<input>       Path to the project root directory.
  -s, --source-analysis=<sourceAnalysis>
                            Analyze a single Rust source file instead of the project.
  -o, --output=<output>     Destination directory to save the output graphs. By default, the SDG formatted as JSON will be printed to the console.
  -a, --analysis-level=<analysisLevel>
                            Level of analysis to perform. Options: 1 (for just symbol table) or 2 (for call graph). Default: 1
  -v, --verbose             Print logs to console.
  -h, --help                Show this help message and exit.
  -V, --version             Print version information and exit.
```

## 3. Installing `codeanalyzer` as a native binary

To install `codeanalyzer`, follow these steps:

### 3.1. Build the Project

Clone the repository (if you haven't already) and navigate into the cloned directory.

Run Cargo to build and install the project:

```bash
cargo install --path . --root $HOME/.local
```

### 3.2. Using `codeanalyzer`

Assuming `$HOME/.local/bin` is in your `$PATH`, after installation, you can use `codeanalyzer` by following the below format:

```help
Usage: codeanalyzer [-hqV] [-i=<input>] -o=<outDir>
Convert Rust binary (*.rlib, *.so) to a dependency graph.
  -h, --help         Show this help message and exit.
  -i, --input=<input>  Path to the input Rust project or binary.
  -o, --output=<outDir>  Destination directory to save the output graphs.
  -q, --quiet        Don't print logs to console.
  -V, --version      Print version information and exit.
```

## FAQ

1. After making a few code changes, my native binary gives random exceptions. But, my code works perfectly in debug mode.

   The dependency graph may be out of sync. Please follow the below instructions:

   a. Build the release version using `cargo build --release`

   b. Run the following command:

   ```sh
   RUST_BACKTRACE=1 ./target/release/codeanalyzer -i ./test_project -a 2 -v
   ```

   c. Then rebuild using the installation instructions in [ยง3.1](./README.md#31-build-the-project).

   The problem should be resolved.
